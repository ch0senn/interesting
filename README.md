Clever Coinbase Card Overview

The card itself is a regular Coinbase VISA Debit Card
It is the system that supports it that makes it clever.
The card is the end-point for the "Daily Limit".
The user must decide on a daily amount of money they want available to spend on their card.

All other funds stay in the system.
The main balance consists of a deposit, which is made in one of the following ways -

1	The user themselves provides the deposit

2	A third party investor

3	There is no balance to speak of (less than $1000)

Let us say that we are under condition 1 and that the user has provided their own deposit of $50,000 from personal finances. Now the product that we are using has a scheme that pays the referer of a user 50% as a commission on initial deposits, but we will not take our commission so as to boost the balance. The balance is now $75,000 on day one.
Now we start to run the bot on the balance so it increses with evey day that passes. A figure queted by Coinbase themselves as a daily % áge gain is 0.28%, so that we can expect our initial $75,000 to have increased by $210.                                                                                                                    
So without any other inputs from the user, they would have $210 to spend every day. But we are not finished there. We have the PI() profits to consider, and then the daily freebies of BTC. And also the profits generated by the work done by the user himself, for which he has been paid into his account. I would say that an average user working just two hours per day would generate at least $100.

Lets say that the balance increases by $310 a day amd that he spends the $210 limit which he set for himself. The next day the initial balance would be $75,100 and the proccess would repeat on the larger amount. He would not increase his limit, and the initial daily balance would grow.

He has not deposited any of the money he earns at work, and he has a foolproof system that will last forever.

Now let´s consider condition 2, where a third party investor puts up the initial balance of $50,000 and is only interested in the financial rewards. In this case, we take our commision of $25,000 and add it to our own balance to which we are runing the same bot.. Now, the $50,000 balance will grow by the expected 0.28% per day and the balance will grow in the compound interest way. But the user must work that bit harder, or spend less. Let´s say the user has the same $210 daily limit as the previous user
